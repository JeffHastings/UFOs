# UFOs
Module 11

The client would like the table to be filtered even further than the initial “Index.html” which currently filters by the date.  The client would like the team to include the ability to filter by more column headers such as:
1.	 Date
2.	City
3.	State
4.	Country
5.	Shape

The team has created the “Challenge.html” which provides that capability through the addition of if-else statements for the new variables, a new function “filterTable()” which takes the filtered data and builds a table for the results.  The client feels that the ability to pinpoint a search by date and country, for example, would go a long way in providing more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings.

My recommendation would be to offer drop down menus to control for key errors as well as an illustrative description of “shape” as some sightings may be classified differently when in fact, they are the same.
